# How-To Contribute A Fabulous and Nebulous CharBody.json

It's pretty easyâ€”you don't have to have any previous knowledge, it would not be that bad!

Let's start a step-by-step guide

1. First
   - copy the linked example above
   - create/upload a new file after `Character_NameBody.json`
     - **Character_Name** should be replaced with the name of the Char.

2. Filling a CharBody.json
   - Author
     - **name**: Insert here the name and slogan for the character
       - Don't forget to add a colon between slogan and name
     - **icon_url**: Lookup the icon of the Char in the downloaded Icon File/Fan Kit
       - Upload it to imgur.com
       - Copy the link and insert it
     - **colour**: Normally, the decimal colour code should already be included
       - Check if it is the right one
         - Colour: `5406831`
